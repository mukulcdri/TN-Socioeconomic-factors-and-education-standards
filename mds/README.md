### Scenario
<p>You are a team of data journalists at a major online news organization. The news room staff has taken an interest in Tennessee, and has asked your team to develop a picture of Tennesseans and how they differ across (and within) counties, particularly in regard to socioeconomic factors like education and income.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to learn more about whether educational factors are related to income for Tennesseans.</p>

#### Steps
  1. **Read, clean, and join the IRS, Education, and Zip Code data.**
     - **Use tidyverse "verbs"** </br>

     **mutate()** adds new variables that are functions of existing variables </br>
     **select()** picks variables based on their names. </br>
     **filter()** picks cases based on their values. </br>
     **summarize()** reduces multiple values down to a single summary. </br>
     **arrange()** changes the ordering of the rows. </br>

     - **Use purrr when applicable** </br>

  2. **Do some exploratory data analysis.**
    - Use ggplot2 for visualizations
    - Use the cor() function to look for correlations
    - Use comments throughout to articulate the thinking that has informed your choices

  3. **Use your exploratory data analysis as the foundation to fit a linear regression model.**
